NFO-Generator
=============

Generates an NFO for a video file

Installation
------------

1. If you don't already have it, get [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download).
2. If you're on Linux, go get FFmpeg and MediaInfo and place them in your PATH (they're included for Mac and Windows).
3. Open a terminal (command prompt on Windows) and type: `npm install -g NFO-Generator` (run as root or administrator)!
4. `cd` to the directory with a video file
5. Run `mknfo "name_of_video_file.mkv"`
6. Wait a couple minutes for everything to run (taking screenshots and uploading them to Lookpic takes a bit).
7. Examine your output file at "name_of_video_file.NFO". Happy? Good!
